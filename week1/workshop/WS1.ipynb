Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create nicely formatted text with headings, lists, links, images, and more. Markdown cells are great for providing explanations, documenting your work, and making your notebook more reader-friendly. Try to double click this text and see what happens. Yes, you should now see the source code put in the markdown cell. Click the Run button in the tool bar or type Ctrl+Enter to execute this markdown to see the executed output of this markdown cell.\n"
